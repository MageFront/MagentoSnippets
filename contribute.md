#How to contribute?

1. Fork this repo. If you are using mac, fork directly in the directory:
`/Users/YOURUSER/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/MagentoSnippets/` it will "automatically" install and enable the plugin in your ST editor;

1. Install in your Sublime Text, via Package Control the plugin [Scope Hunter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/ScopeHunter);

1. If you already have the MagentoSnippets installed, remove it by the command palette Package Control: remove package/repository;

1. Create your own snippets following the directory structure or create a new directory;

1. Test the snippets that you have createad, mainly the right scope using the Scope Hunter plugin;

1. After all tests, create a new pull request for this repository.


Don't forget to remove the forked repo in the Packages directory, or just keep it updated with master :)


I will create new tags for each 5 new snippets added.

If you have any question please comment it here, for suggestions create an new issue.

Thanks!
